## Toolbox App for Ideas

This is a project for myself for storing and remembering ideas that might be used, put into one app.

All of this stems from game development ideas, which is a multidimensional artform. Instead of branching ideas everywhere, this will put them in one box.

## Components
Notes: A Markdown note taking app for rough sticky notes level idea jotting

Documents: A Rich Text File based document for more complex files

Screenplay: Dialog/Scenes for Game Scenes or Short form Movies

Drawing: Simple MS Paint inspired drawing app for jotting down rough ideas in a visual way

Moodboard: A idea board maily for collages of various images

Storyboard: Art Direction for visual story direction
