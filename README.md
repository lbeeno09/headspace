## Toolbox App for Ideas

This is a project for myself for storing and remembering ideas that might be used, put into one app.

# About this App

This app is made in C# with WinUI. I have been thinking about this for at least 3 months and may have taken around 400 hrs. for the first draft.

This app has been developed on my own. Since this app is my first official app to develop in C#, it has been a challenging yet fulfilling adventure. 

All of this stems from game development ideas, which is a multidimensional artform. Instead of branching ideas everywhere, this will put them in one box.
